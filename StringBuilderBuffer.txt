In Java, StringBuilder is a mutable class used to efficiently manipulate strings.
Unlike String (immutable), it allows modifications such as append, insert, delete, and reverse
without creating new objects, making it faster and memory-efficient for frequent string operations


🔑 Key Points About StringBuilder
Package: java.lang
Mutable: Strings can be changed without creating new objects.
Performance: Faster than String for repeated modifications.
Thread Safety: Not synchronized (unlike StringBuffer), so use it in single-threaded contexts.
Common Use Case: Building or modifying strings dynamically, e.g., concatenating in loops.

⚙️ Common Methods in StringBuilder
append(String str) → Adds text at the end.
insert(int offset, String str) → Inserts text at a given position.
delete(int start, int end) → Removes characters in a range
reverse() → Reverses the sequence.
toString() → Converts back to a String.

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind
Use StringBuilder when working in single-threaded environments and performance matters.
Use StringBuffer if thread safety is required.
Avoid String concatenation in loops—it creates many temporary objects, slowing performance.

StringBuffer
============

In Java, StringBuffer is a mutable sequence of characters, similar to StringBuilder, but synchronized and therefore thread-safe.
It’s best used when multiple threads may access and modify the same string.

🔑 Key Features of StringBuffer
Mutable: You can modify the content without creating new objects.
Thread-Safe: All methods are synchronized, making it safe in multithreaded environments2.
Performance: Slightly slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization overhead.
Capacity: Default capacity is 16 characters, but it grows automatically as needed.
Package: Part of java.lang.


⚙️ Common Methods in StringBuffer
append(String str) → Adds text at the end.
insert(int offset, String str) → Inserts text at a given position.
delete(int start, int end) → Removes characters in a range.
replace(int start, int end, String str) → Replaces characters in a range.
reverse() → Reverses the sequence.
capacity() → Returns current buffer capacity.
toString() → Converts back to a String


⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind
Use StringBuffer when working in multi-threaded environments where synchronization is required.
Use StringBuilder in single-threaded contexts for better performance.
Avoid String concatenation in loops—it creates many temporary objects.
